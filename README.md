# ngxTimer
Visual countdown clock (stopwatch) compponent using Angular 2+

This project is currently suspended as we port it to React and add many features in the process. It will be resumed in the future, likely backported from the hopefully stable React counter part. 

Update: the React component was [released here](https://github.com/sonbachmi/ReactVisualTimer).
